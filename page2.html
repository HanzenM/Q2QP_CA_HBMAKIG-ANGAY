We promote Arbor Day celebrations and offer educational resources to raise awareness about the importance of trees and sustainability, while also providing opportunities for carbon offsetting. "Team Trees," a collaborative initiative with YouTubers MrBeast and Mark Rober, amplifies these efforts by encouraging donations to plant 20 million trees through the Arbor Day Foundation. We have garnered widespread support, showcasing the collective impact of individuals coming together to contribute to global reforestation efforts.</div>
